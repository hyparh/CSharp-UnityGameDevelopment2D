  storyText: 'You quietly go to examine the sound... and see an alien thoroughly
    to make a cocoon out of his victim - a marine. You are shocked of the view and
    make one unintentional step back. That one makes noise and the alien becomes
    alert!



    You see a door a few meters away with a red glowing text "EXIT"
    above it.



    What you''re gonna do?



    1. Run towards it!

    2. Hide
    behind the near pillar.'
